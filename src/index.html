          pain I have known. I am not a hero. I am vengeance. I am the night.

            <h3 class="text-4xl font-bold">About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm <span class="font-bold">Batman ü¶á</span> a dedicated vigilante, skilled strategist, and tireless defender of <span class="font-bold">Gotham City</span>. My life is guided by a strong sense of justice, discipline, and commitment to protecting those who cannot defend themselves. I use my intelligence, combat skills, and cutting-edge technology to fight crime and maintain order, always acting with discretion and precision.</p>
            <p>My experience in crime-fighting includes years of direct confrontation with some of the world's most dangerous criminal minds, such as the <span class="font-bold">Joker, Two-Face, and the Riddler</span>. Through meticulous analysis and tactical thinking, I dismantle criminal networks and prevent attacks that threaten the city's safety. I have trained extensively in various martial arts, <span class="font-bold">mastering more than 100 combat styles ü•ã</span>, in addition to having advanced knowledge in forensic investigation and criminal psychology.</p>
            <p>In addition to my activities as a vigilante, I am the CEO of a large corporation üè¢, one of the world's largest, operating in various sectors such as technology, healthcare, and infrastructure. My leadership is based on innovation, ethics, and investments in social initiatives, always aiming for sustainable development and <span class="font-bold">improved quality of life for Gotham's citizens</span>.</p>
            <p>I believe that true strength does not lie in physical power, but in the determination to keep fighting, even in the face of adversity. <span class="font-bold">My mission goes beyond vengeance: it is an unwavering commitment to justice and the hope of a safer future for everyone</span>. If there is a threat in the shadows, I will be there to face it.</p>
